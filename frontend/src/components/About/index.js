            The world of data is menacingly deep and still largely uncharted, 
            however using available data analysis tools and smart visual design elements 
            we can reap benefits in all fields of interest. To me it's only natural that 
            I would take on the task of bringing clarity to all the data I can get my 
            hands on. That's why I am interested in everything related to data - 
            gathering, validation, manipulation, visual representation and analysis.
